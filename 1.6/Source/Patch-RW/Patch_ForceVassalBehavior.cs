    /// Vassal via WorldUtility.IsVassalFaction). That behavior is then serialized and NEVER
    /// re-derived for an already-tracked faction on load (AddRimWarFaction only runs for
    /// factions not already in the restored list).

    /// So a save whose PColony RimWarData was persisted with a non-Vassal behavior - e.g. it was
    /// first enrolled before the Vassal classification applied, or the field defaulted to the
    /// serialized fallback (Expansionist) - loads as a normal AI faction. RimWar then dispatches
    /// trade caravans / scouts / warbands from the player's Empire settlements every evaluation
    /// cycle, flooding the player with caravans. (And because Empire rebuilds PColony's trader
    /// pawnGroupMaker at runtime, those dispatches can fail vanilla CanGenerateFrom, spamming
    /// "no usable PawnGroupMakers for Trader".)
    ///
    /// This postfix re-asserts the Vassal classification on load for the Empire faction only: the
    /// single RimWarData whose faction is Empire's PColony (matched via FactionCache, not RimWar's
    /// broader IsVassalFaction) is forced back to Vassal if its behavior drifted. Vassal is RimWar's
    /// own intended classification for PColony - it excludes the faction from both the per-settlement
    /// action loop and the global action dispatch, while preserving the vassal-relation/heat handling
    /// the rest of Empire's RimWar compat relies on (unlike Excluded, which would drop PColony from
    /// RimWar entirely). Runs at PostLoadInit only; the value is then re-saved as Vassal, so the
    /// repair is permanent for that save.
